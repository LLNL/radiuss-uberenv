# RADIUSS Uberenv

The RADIUSS project promotes and supports key High Performance Computing (HPC) open-source software developed at the LLNL. These tools and libraries cover a wide range of features a team would need to develop a modern simulation code targeting HPC plaftorms.

RADIUSS Uberenv project aims at creating a bundle package for RADIUSS projects with the help of uberenv, and test it with CI.

## Getting Started

This project is standalone and mainly consist of configuarion files for spack.

### Prerequisites

This project introduces a radiuss bundle (spack) package in `scripts/uberenv/packages`. It relies on uberenv to download and configure spack in a reproducible way, useful to set things up in a control environment.

### Installing

This project requires no installation. Installing RADIUSS bundle package requires to run uberenv python script:

```
> python scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py
```

This has only be tested on Livermore Computing quartz. The goal being both to extend the number of machines it can be used on and complete the list of packages in RADIUSS bundle packages.

## Running the tests

Testing consist in building the bundle package on LC Gitlab CI.

TODO: automate the update of spack.
